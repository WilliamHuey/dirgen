log the top level entries in the linesInfo
and use to keep a ref for consistent generation
of children when down with current line

top line repeated validator logic redo
  should only write the latest line on repeats

does not gen twnsbxh

version timing problem on the tests
test deeply nested folder structures

Backlog/Optimize
-- pluralizing the error messages
-try catch in the async await is required
-right and left trim
npm start more compatible with windows
-combinations of warnings
--programatic use should have object pass in
--remove existsAsync when used programmatically

--encoding type
--permission level
--step through
  --overwrite
  -warn [skip|ignore|walk]

Module
-module type support
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
  -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
  npmignore and gitignore
