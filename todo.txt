  log the repeated line validation messages but only the top level folders that have children elements.

version timing problem on the tests
test deeply nested folder structures

Backlog/Optimize

-try catch in the async await is required
-right and left trim
npm start more compatible with windows
-combinations of warnings
--programatic use should have object pass in
--remove existsAsync when used programmatically

--encoding type
--permission level
--step through
  --overwrite
  -warn [skip|ignore|walk]

Module
-module type support
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
